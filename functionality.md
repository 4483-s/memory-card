# expected functionalities:

- initial page for selecting difficulties
- hard: 40 entries, medium: 20 entries, easy: 15 cards
- all resources urls should be loaded when initial page load
- one mode should have its own score board
- changing entry sets requires a full reload
- best score records are within mode selection buttons, displayed as 5/12, and a big scoreboard for the current turn
- no restart for a mode, must do so by switching mode

### 2025-11-18 update

- use fix items for lists of each difficulty instead of random ones to reduce cached image numbers
